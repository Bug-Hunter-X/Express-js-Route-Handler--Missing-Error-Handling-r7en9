# Express.js Route Handler: Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: inadequate error handling. The example shows a route that fetches user data from a database.  However, it fails to handle errors properly, leading to potential issues like:

* **Generic error messages:** Users receive unhelpful error messages like "Something went wrong."
* **Missing 404 handling:**  If a user ID is not found, the application should return a proper 404 (Not Found) response.
* **Security risks:**  Revealing sensitive error details (stack traces, database errors) can compromise security.

The solution demonstrates how to improve error handling, providing better user experience and enhanced security.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (you'll need a database driver).
4. Run `node bug.js` to see the buggy behavior.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved error handling.
